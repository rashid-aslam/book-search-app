# Technical questions

1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment?
I spent roughly eight hours on the assignment
- What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
I would add Typescript, loading state, pagination and a book detail page, SEO
- If you didn&#39;t spend much time on the coding test, then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
I would improve code test coverage to above 85%
2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen
language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you&#39;ve used it.
Javascript arrow functions is a very useful feature which I have used mostly in my solution where the context needs to be same as the closure
3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
I have done this in production by using the chrome dev tools performance insight and [google page speed insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/)
4. How would you improve the API that you just used?
I would probably change the data structure. Since, I don't comprehend their data so it would be hard to suggest anything now.
5. Please describe yourself using correctly formatted JSON.
